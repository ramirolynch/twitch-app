# SWITCH - Built in React/Typescript
https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html

An application used to browse, search and build a list of favorite streamers and games using Twitch.tv's API service.

## Installation
`npm install react`
`npm start`

## Navigating
The application is made up of 4 pages:

-Trending: the 20 most live viewed streams on Twitch currently.

-Top Games: the 20 most popular games on Twitch currently.

-Search: search function pulling from Twitch's search API.

-Favorites: a local list of saved favorite streamers/games.

On any page, a stream or game can be favorited and added to the user's list of favorites. The number of favorites is displayed in the header. Alternatively, you may navigate straight to a channel by clicking any thumbnail, title or 'Go to' button. Clicking the 'SWITCH' logo will navigate you to Twitch's home page.

## About
This project was created by Britta Fountain, Ramiro Lynch and Dylan Lokatys in about a week. Our biggest challenge was data organization and implementing this into our components. With more time the following features would be developed:

-Embedded streams
-Chat interaction
-Clips/Clips search
-Stream preview
-Ability to login
